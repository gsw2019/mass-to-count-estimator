        MTCE was spawned from an idea that real-life monotonous processes could be sped up and improved.
        Created to help individuals and businesses quickly estimate the quantity of small, countable items based on their total mass.
        This is useful in scenarios where counting each item individually is impractical or time-consuming, such as in inventory management, packaging, or quality control processes.
      </p>
      <p className="pt-2">
        By leveraging easy to record data, MTCE provides a simple and effective way to approximate item counts, saving time and reducing labor.
        The application aims to streamline operations and improve efficiency in any settings where large, accurate item counts are required.
